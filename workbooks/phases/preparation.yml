description: Incident response methodologies typically emphasize preparation not only for establishing an incident response capability so that the organization is ready to respond to incidents, but also preventing incidents by ensuring that systems, networks, and applications are sufficiently secure. Incident response teams need to know what they have available and what they need to prepare, aquire or configure for success within the incident response process.
