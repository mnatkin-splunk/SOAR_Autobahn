description: The SANS incident response process has several phases. SANS PICERL incident process describes the six major phases of the incident response processes that are `preparation`, `identification`, `containment`, `eradication`, `recovery`, and `lessons learned` with the activities in detail. This process is used to build effective incident response plans.  This particular response template aligns to the NIST 800-61r2 model (preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident) format produced by SANS Cybersecurity Training Organization.

how_to_implement: Organizations should use this workbook as a template to assist in the defination of the procedure and outline the processes for their security operations teams.
Preparation in this workbook defines the tasks that should be done prior to instituting a response process and should not be imported into response tools that support ingestion. 
Preparation is here purely for assisting with the necessary items needed prior to instituting a response process properly
